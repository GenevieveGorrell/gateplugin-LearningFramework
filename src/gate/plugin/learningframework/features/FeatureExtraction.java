  // We have to make sure that no two feature names that come from different attribute specifications
  // can be identical, and also that the different feature names that can come from the same attribute
  // specification for NGRAM and ATTRIBUTELIST are different from each other and those from other specs.
  // Also, the feature name should still be as short as possible, readable and contain as few
  // special characters as possible. 
  // Here is what we use for now:
  // If a NAME is specified in the attribute definition, then that name is used as the 
  // first part of the feature name prefix, optionally followed by #[i] where [i] is then
  // number of the attribute list element, e.g. "#-1". This means that an attribute name should
  // not contain numbers. 
  // If a NAME is not specified, then the feature name prefix is constructed in the following way
  // instead:
  // it starts with a "feature indicator" which is "A" for attribute, N[k] for
  // an ngram, A[i] for the ith entry in an attributelist and M[i]N[k] for an attribute list
  // for ngrams with n>1 (future!)
  // The feature indicator is followed by the NAMESEP character, then followed by the annotation
  // type, followed by NAMESEP and followed by the feature name. For a boolean feature
  // which indicates the presence of an annotation, the featuer name is empty.
  // This is either the whole feature name or it is followed by VALSEP and followed by the 
  // actual nominal value, if the feature is for a nominal value coded as one-of-k.
  // The value for an ngram is all the individual grams, concatenated witth NGRAMSEP.

  
  // NOTE: currently these strings are hard-coded but it may make sense to look if there 
  // are better choices or make these configurable in some advanced section of the featureName config
  // file.
