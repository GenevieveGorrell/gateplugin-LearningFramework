/**
 * How to treat/represent missing values when creating the instances.
 *
 * "keep" tries to preserve the missing value for the learning algorithm. This is done by
 * representing the missing value as a value that is not otherwise used: for one_of_k
 * representations, all k features are set to 0.0, for numeric representations of a nominal value,
 * -1 is used, for numeric features, NaN is used and for boolean 0.5 is used. NOTE: this will only
 * work if the algorithm supports missing values in some way!
 *
 * "special_value" replaces the missing value with a special value that should be different from
 * all other values, but still can be handled by algorithms which do not support missing values.
 * This is not really always possible, but the values used are a hopefully good compromise: for
 * nominal features, the value "%%%NA%%%" is used, for numeric values "-1.0" is used and for
 * boolean "0.5" is used if the boolean is represented as a number, otherwise false is used.
 *
 * "zero_value" is similar to "special_value" but uses the "zero" value for the datatype, i.e. the
 * empty string for nominal, false for boolean and 0.0 for numeric.
 *
 * "ignore_instance" records the fact that a missing value is present in the instance and filters
 * the instance. This means that the instance is not used for training and at application time,
 * that no classification is performed for it.
 *
 * "impute_mostfreq" initially uses "keep" but makes another pass over all instances at training
 * time and replaces the value with the most frequent value. This may not be a good idea for
 * truely continuous numeric features. The same value is then also used at application time.
 *
 * "impute_median" initially uses "keep" but makes another pass over all isntances at training
 * time and replaces the value with the median value. At application time, that median value is
 * also used.
 *
 * "use_value" uses the value giving in the element MISSINGVALUEVALUE for the attribute.
 *
 * NOTE: not all treatments are yet implemented!!!!
